<!-- because the lists are best semantically structured with the nested <ul><li></li></ul> tags, for unordered lists with individual list iterms for example, I will fix the code up below. Also, the <br> (line break) tag is one of those weird tags like the <img> tag, which is "self-closing" - does not require a closing tag. -->

<strong>Read & Do, per the outline presented below:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Homework Assignment, Week 6 - Assessment activity - Create a Webpage and Style it</li>
<li>Extra credit, sketch out the page before doing this work & hand in / scan - photo and include that scan / photo of sketch</li>
<li>Create a professional webpage about yourself with sections, as defined here:</li>
<li>html structure must include:</li>
<li>doctype declaration, head, body</li>
<li>in the body, there should be a couple of html5 semantic elements to mark out the segments of the page - there must be a header, content area, footer, for example (feel free to add others, as appropriate)</li>
<li>in the header, include a heading element</li>
<li>in the content area, there must be at least:</li>
<li>one form of list in the main content area</li>
<li>at least one image or video in the page, taking care not to violate copyright</li>
<li>Create an external stylesheet referenced by the webpage with at least the following style refinements:</li>
<li>a heading color</li>
<li>a non-default text / font (size, weight, family) in some section</li>
<li>Mount on a github repository as a page:</li>
<li>name your webpage - index.html</li>
<li>activate Github Pages in the settings on the repository</li>
</ul>

<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/css/paris.jpg" alt="don't forget to add an alt text attribute to your img tag"> 
<!-- image is one of the rare odd html tags that "self-closes." It is one of the few that does NOT require a closer, so I'm commenting out the </img> tag here /img -->
